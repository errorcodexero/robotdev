C++ source code is uses and indent of four.  Tab widths are set to four and
indentation can be expanded to spaces or tabs as long as tabs are assumed to
be four characters wide.

For emacs, the following works well in your .emacs file

(setq c-default-style "linux")
(setq c-basic-offset 4)
(setq tab-width 4)
(setq indent-tabs-mode t)


For VIM the following works well for your VIMRC file
set tabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4


For other editors there are always settings to achieve the same result.
