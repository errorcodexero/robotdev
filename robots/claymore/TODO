Master TODO List
----------------
1. Create Robot Initialization Code for power up (detail below)
2. Lifter Manual Height
   - Use Encoders to limit top and bottom travel
   - Use Limit Switches to limit top and bottom travel
3. Lifter Auto Height
   - Go To Height
     - Mapping from Encoder To Height
	 - PID Control of lift motors
   - Go To Preset
     - Read presets from params.txt file
4. Lifter switch to low gear
5. Grabber Manual Open/Close
   - Use Encoders to limit travel in and out
6. Grabber Open/Close Preset
   - Cube width
   - Wider than cube width
6. Grabber Intake Motors Manual
   - Turn on in inward direction
   - Turn on in outward direction (place)
   - Turn on in outward direction (throw)
   - Detect cube in back of grabber, stop intake
7. Drivebase shift low/high gear
8. Autonomous - cross line
   - Create simple cross line (e.g. drive straight)
9. Autonomous - score on switch
   - detect field side in select auto mode
   - step for robot initialization
   - test lifter to height while running drivebase auto steps
   - create spit out steps

Robot Initialization On Power Up
--------------------------------

Note, we should run this as as the first autonomous step.  We should have
a robot initialization auto step.

Competition Bot
  Starting State
    We start with the lifter at the bottom and the grabber folded into the lifter holding cube

  Steps
    1. Drop grabber from lifter (may cause us to lose cube)
    2. If Lower limit hall effect switch not active, assume hall effect switch broken (set hall
	   effect broken flag in lifter controller)
    3. Set the lifter lower limit encoder value as the base encoder value
    4. Open grabber slightly
    5. Turn on intake
	6. Close Grabber until encoders stop moving
	7. Stop intake
    8. Store encoder value for grabber as the base encoder value
