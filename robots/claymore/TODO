Robot Initialization On Power Up
--------------------------------

Note, we should run this as as the first autonomous step.  We should have
a robot initialization auto step.

Competition Bot
  Starting State
    We start with the lifter at the bottom and the grabber folded into the lifter holding cube

  Steps
    1. Drop grabber from lifter (may cause us to lose cube)
    2. If Lower limit hall effect switch not active, assume hall effect switch broken (set hall
	   effect broken flag in lifter controller)
    3. Set the lifter lower limit encoder value as the base encoder value
    4. Open grabber slightly
    5. Turn on intake
	6. Close Grabber until encoders stop moving
	7. Stop intake
    8. Store encoder value for grabber as the base encoder value

TODO List - Practice Bot for Scrimmage
--------------------------------------

Lifter
------
- Goto Height
  o Mapping from encoder to height
  o PID control for height
- Presets get read from params.txt
- OI/Gamepad up & down
- Climbing
  o Shift to low gear
  
Collector
---------
- Go to angle
  o Start with cube/calibrate
  o Limit angle to max based on calibration
- Make sure we can hang onto cube while lifting
- place cube
- spit cube
- Collecting
  o Detect cube at back, stop intake

Drive Base
----------
- Shift Gears

Autonomous
----------
- Detect field side
- Score on switch
