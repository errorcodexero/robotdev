HIGH PRIORITY:

NOT AS HIGH PRIORITY:
	- Logging
	- Laptop configuration
		-ssh config:
			-Fix the "rm ~/.ssh/known_hosts" problem
			-add "StrictHostKeyChecking no/UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" for robot


NICE THINGS TO HAVE:
	- Expand testing of the different robot modes
	- Log Analysis
	- Fix talon srx initialization: separate address for CANs and accessing index for them in the talon_srx_controls array
	- Clean-up stuff:
		- Use enum class more places
		- Use std::array in place of C arrays in several places
	- Meta IO information
		- Add a function that will discover which IOs different parts use (and make a nice list)
		- Make a data type to talk about different inputs
	

Eric's random thoughts:
	-Sim stuff could benefit from using Monitor
